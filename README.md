# cukes-rest
cukes-rest takes simplicity of Cucumber and provides bindings for HTTP specification. As a sugar on top, cukes-rest
adds steps for storing and using request/response content from a file system, variable support in .features, context 
inflation in all steps and resources and a custom plug-in system to allow users to add additional project specific
content.
